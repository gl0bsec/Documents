		- ### Risk Modifiers
			- Intensification/militarisation of Iranian diplomatic tone
			- Declarations of kinetic action by Coalition diplomats
			- Israeli precision strikes beyond its borders
			- Chinese/Russian diplomatic allignment with Iranian statements
			- Indications of disconnect/fragmentation within Coalition members/Coalition narratives
			- Directly contradictory narratives/diplomatic statements made by partners of previous maritime security regime (I.E., Egypt/Djibouti & Prosperity Guardian)
			- Escalation in warfighting platform deployment to region + transfer of weapons between relevant parties
			- Significant increase in cyber activity/targeted attacks
			- Significant call up of "military aged males"
			- Uptick/Downtick in kinetic activity
			- Increase in SOF operations
			- Disconnect/Contradiction between Coalition statements and action taken on part of corporate actors
			- Significant disruption of public services/utilities/defence by cyber actors (i.e., cyber/kinetic nexus)
