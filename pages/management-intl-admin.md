# Management in International Administrations
	- Institutional focus: agencies and secretariats- administrative/executive wing of institutions
	- "Agencies": specialized bodies responsible for implementing policy or programs (OECD, WHO, FRONTEX)
	- Institutional power vs norms and agenda setting
		- OECD PISA study, information strategy to set education agenda
	- International Organisations (IOs)
		- Autonomous bodies with their own interests, goals and preferences
		- Internal structure determines behavior
	- International bureaucracies are converging to the structures of national ones, public administration literature becomes relevant + IR literature
	- International vs National Bureaucracies:
		- Control + Accountability
			- Direct vs Indirect implementation
		- Limited oversight
			- Decision-making primarily done by 'experts' vs Democratic processes
		- Sources of Personnel
			- Member state appointees vs Organised civil service
	- Delegation and control:
		- Delegation: expedite processes where there's a national capacity deficit
		- Control: establish or achieve a political agenda
	- Institutional drift: bureaucrats are socialized into their own SOPs and values
		- Euro steal and coal community -> modern European Union
	- Legitimacy is mediated by acceptance by:
		- Citizens
		- Member States
		- Interest groups
	- Normative (theoretical) vs Sociological/Descriptive legitimacy (opinion)
