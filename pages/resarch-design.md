## Comparative (Small-N) Designs

- Require a separate treatment, because they face challenges of a different scale, although not altogether of a different type, from large-N observational research.
- "Comparative designs" primarily developed in the tradition of comparative politics. Looking at why a government A failed versus government B.
- Cannot rely exclusively on strategies such as randomization and conditioning nor on the law of large numbers.
- The available observations are too few and their diversity is limited.
- The boundary between small- and large-N research is fuzzy and contingent on the state of the art in the scientific field.
- Have no unique approach to causation on their own but combine the strategies of large-N designs with the approach of within-case analysis.
  - Identify confirmatory vs disconfirmatory evidence.
  - Explore internal vs external validity.
- **Within case analysis**: It provides causal explanations not by studying cross-case patterns, but by evaluating competing hypotheses against numerous pieces of evidence (data) all concerning a single case.
  - Within-case evidence can uncover the causal mechanisms through which causal relationships operate.
  - Matches well the goal of accounting for the particular outcomes of the cases, as a particular mode of explanatory analysis.
  - Questions about alternative explanations that cannot be addressed at the stage of cross-case comparisons can be further scrutinized during the in-depth within-case stage.
- **Cross-Case Inference:** Evaluating competing hypotheses against numerous pieces of evidence (data) all concerning a single case.
- Designs for explanatory research need to put the emphasis on different aspects of the logic of inquiry from its experimental and large-N counterparts.
  - Cannot rely on the law of large numbers to reduce measurement error.
  - Within-case analysis complimented by careful case selection is critical to mitigating error.
  - May be affected by measurement errors: divergence of target and measurement.
  - Small-N comparisons are just not suitable for the study of very weak and heterogeneous causal relationships.
  - Less effective at ruling out randomness as an explanation.
- *Estimation of partial average causal effects is less important* than building comprehensive explanatory accounts of outcomes, and then for each case being studied. The *interplay of these detailed explanatory accounts and the cross-case patterns emerging when they are juxtaposed to each other* is where the real power of small-N comparative research lies.
- Useful for *inductively* deriving/generating hypotheses and theories (identify causal mechanisms or explain a series of cases).
- *Deductively* testing narrower hypotheses vs general ones.

### Deductive designs (cross-case inference)

- Theoretically motivated, "does mechanism/variable X account for outcome/observation Y".
- Most Similar Systems Design 1 (MSSD 1):
  - Isolating confounds and main variables.
  - E.g., "Federal systems" -> "crisis response capacity".
  - Similarity of systems: key to isolating confounds and emphasize on the main variables.
  - Major issue is identifying similar systems/sufficient amount of cases.
  - Run analysis on both cases —> compare significance of variables in both cases.
    - If MEV yes —> do not reject null hypothesis.
    - If MEV no —> reject null hypothesis.

### Inductive designs (cross-case inference)

- Inference made about the possible causal relationship between a set of variables/observations (MSSD 2 and MDSD).
- MSSD2:
  - Used to analyze and explain empirical puzzles.
  - Assists in reasoning from the cases to potential explanations.
  - Main explanatory variable is unknown, control and outcome variables are known. What is the explanatory variable?

### Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) (cross-case inference)

- Medium N inductive approach.
- Qualitative comparative analysis.
- Boolean minimisation (crisp set, multivariate, fuzzy set).
- Generalization of paired comparison analysis as done in MSSD1.
- Helps with conjectural causality and allows for the observation of equifinality.
- Helps identify/analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions of a given outcome or outcomes.
- INUS condition: individually insufficient part of a purely sufficient condition.

## Explanations and Causal Inference

- Causal statements require a stronger epistemic criterion than descriptive ones:
  - E.g., Football and skin color: categorical factors (player position) are significant given the overall disparity in colored vs white players.
  - Perl ladder of causation.
- **Counterfactual definition of causality**: the effect of an observed factor in the face of static or normal conditions.
- Counterfactuals are approximated, thus are probabilistic. Primarily deal with unobservable phenomena.
- **Correlation vs Causation:** mere presence of a factor given an observation does not imply that it has a significant effect.
- **Casual graphs:** constructed via prior lit review to identify key variables, factors, and confounds.
- Nomological (in its deterministic and probabilistic variants), functional, intentional, and mechanistic causal types of explanation.
  - Differ in their underlying explanatory logic and in their primary focus.
- Types of explanation (simplified):
  - Mechanistic: a sequence of events that link cause and effect.
  - Probabilistic: the likelihood of an outcome given an observed factor.
- Dealing with reverse causation:
  - Time series data helps (if X precedes Y).
  - Control for spurious causation (confounds).

### Types of explanation

- **Covering laws ('deductive nomological')**:
  - An outcome is explained if it can be deductively subsumed under principles having the character of general laws.
  - Theories explain why and under what circumstances these laws hold. Laws are more than empirical generalizations and require a certain necessity rather than the existence of mere regularities (which might after all be accidental).
- **Probabilistic-nomological explanation**:
  - Determinism is too strong a requirement, we can relax it and reformulate laws in probabilistic form.
  - It comes with its own set of problems.
- **Functional explanations**:
  - To put it even more succinctly, the consequences of the behaviour are its causes.
  - There needs to be a causal mechanism that rewards and filters beneficial behaviour or traits in order to make them dominant or prevalent in a population.
- **Intentional explanations**:
  - Explanations in terms of beliefs coupled with intentions (desires, wants, interests, needs, reasons, and so on) are also teleological and have their part to play in political science analysis.
- **Mechanistic explanation**:
  - A mechanistic explanation identifies causes and effects and the causal paths linking them. It answers the question of how the cause produces the effect by tracing the links of a causal chain or the interactions of the elements of a mechanistic model.
  - Identifies a number of different causal paths through which the cause and the effect are linked, and mediating and moderating variables provide ways to operationalize and eventually test these conjectures.

## **Experimental design**

- Blocked randomization: randomize the treatment variable within confounding categories.
- Experimental setting may influence the outcome etc.
- Experiments are useful when studying attributes/characteristics that are not randomly assigned. Enabling the controlled randomization of the subjects.
- Require the identification and testing of mechanisms.
- Alternative treatments (ITT vs TOT): varying the treatment to test the strength of the effect (the treatment on the treated).
- Randomness: operates with both the treatment and control group. Influences both external and internal validity.
