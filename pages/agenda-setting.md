		- 2. **European Commission (EC)**: As the initiator of EU legislation, the EC conducted preliminary assessments and gathered feedback on the need for reform.

		- 1. **Public Consultations**: The EC held open consultations, allowing citizens, organizations, and businesses to submit their views on data protection reform.
		- 2. **Industry Consultation Bodies**: These included tech companies, SMEs, and large corporations, which provided feedback on the proposed regulation's impact on business practices.
		- 3. **Civil Society Organizations**: Groups like the Civil Liberties Union for Europe and Access Now played a role in advocating for strong data protection and privacy standards in the GDPR.
		- 4. **International Partners and Bodies**: Given the global nature of data flows, international organizations and non-EU countries also had an interest in the GDPR's development.
		- 5. **European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and the Committee of the Regions (CoR)**: These bodies, representing various economic and regional interests within the EU, also provided input.
	- Throughout these stages, the process was characterized by a high degree of consultation and negotiation, reflecting the diverse and sometimes conflicting interests of the various stakeholders. The iterative process involved proposals, feedback, revisions, and compromises to balance the different perspectives and needs related to data protection in the digital age.

- ## Notes on EU agenda setting
	- European Commission makes proposals for legislation that the EP discusses. So the answer to the research question is: Which shifts the question to why did the Commission do that?
	- Take into account who the relevant institutions are and what are the organizations and actors that influence them (and how).
	- The EP does not adopt on its own legislation in the EU, only in codecision with the Council of Ministers.
