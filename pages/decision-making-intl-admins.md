# Decision Making in International Administrations
	- ## Key concepts and facts:
		- **Levels of government**
		- **"Governance"**
			- Refers to: the interactions of actors in the context of a system of government
				- Public-Private networks, negotiation, interest group interactions
			- Refers to: the management of actors in the context of a system of government
				- Regulation, control, performance/"competence" of state or non-actors
		- **Marks and Hooghe (2003): presentation of ML gov as more efficient than central state monopoly**
			- Type I: limited/ non-overlapping jurisdiction, functionalist logic (reducing transaction costs of inter-state cooperation to produce public goods)
			- Type II: "complex" fluid systems, non-hierarchical and self organizing, "a wide range of public and private actors *copmete*"
		- **"Ladders" of governance (Hooghe & Marks, 2023)**
			- Variations in the N levels of governance for various state actors
		- **MLG 'landscapes':**
			- Levels of gov related to a group of state and non-state actors
		- **General purpose (EU) vs Task-specific (WHO)**
			- Different dynamics and problems
		- **Nationalism and MLG (Hooghe & Marks, 2023):**
			- Acts as a key threat to international institutions
			- Variants: regionalism vs "nationalism"
			- no-alternative: MLG is inevitable
		- **Look into:**
			- EU G4-Cities group
			- Hague "security region"
			- "In between spaces": peer-to-peer institutions,unclear responsibilities and jurisdictions (Eur Council)
